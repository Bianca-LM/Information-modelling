				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p><q><span id="initialLetter">C</span>limate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present.</q><a href="#1" class="apex">1</a> Atmospheric and ocean temperatures are rising, <q>[p]recipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, the oceans are becoming more acidic, and the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events are increasing.</q><a href="#2" class="apex">2</a> The 2017 <span class="organization">Climate Science Special Report</span> describes the current state of scientific knowledge about <span class="place">U.S.</span> and global climate change. The report concludes that <q>it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation.</q><a href="#3" class="apex">3</a></p>

				<p>Global data show that 2016 was the warmest year on record and the third consecutive year for record global average surface temperatures.<a href="#4" class="apex">4</a> In the continental <span class="place">United States</span>, 2016 was the second warmest year on record, after 2012, with higher than average precipitation and fifteen climate-related disasters including drought, wildfire, floods, and severe storms, which caused losses of more than $1 billion.<a href="#5" class="apex">5</a></p>

				<p>The emission of greenhouses gases (GHGs),<a href="#6" class="apex">6</a> which move about in the atmosphere, is a major cause of global climate change. GHGs absorb terrestrial radiation that leaves the Earth’s surface. Although GHGs <q>create the natural heat-trapping properties of the atmosphere</q> and are <q>necessary to life as we know it,</q> high concentrations of GHGs cause an increase in the Earth’s absorption of energy and the resulting increase in temperature referred to as global warming.<a href="#7" class="apex">7</a></p>

				<p>Recent research identifies deadly effects of climate change, <q>one of the biggest global threats to human health of the 21st century.</q><a href="#8" class="apex">8</a> If global GHG emissions are not reduced, heat waves will affect 74% of the world’s population by 2100. Even with drastic GHG reductions, almost half of humans will face deadly heat.<a href="#9" class="apex">9</a> In <span class="place">Europe</span>, increasing temperatures will result in weather disasters, especially heat waves and coastal flooding, and a sharp increase in climate-related deaths by 2100.<a href="#10" class="apex">10</a> By 2050, climate change may affect nutrition in developing countries as rising temperatures reduce availability of plant proteins.<a href="#11" class="apex">11</a></p>

				<p>Although a number of U.S. statutes govern human activities related to climate change, no comprehensive climate change legislation exists.<a href="#12" class="apex">12</a> Federal programs (including the <span class="person">Obama</span> administration’s Climate Action Plan<a href="#13" class="apex">13</a>), as well as regional, state, and local initiatives, promised to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. Recent developments, however, have diluted federal efforts.<a href="#14" class="apex">14</a> For example, in March 2017, <span class="person">President Trump</span> revoked significant Obama-administration climate change policies, including the <span class="reference">Climate Action Plan</span> and related strategies.<a href="#15" class="apex">15</a> This revocation and others that followed are likely to result in increased emissions and a failure to meet climate targets (e.g., energy efficiency, methane emissions).<a href="#16" class="apex">16</a></p>

				<p>Significantly, in June 2017, the <span class="organization">United States</span> announced its withdrawal from the <span class="reference">Paris Agreement</span>,<a href="#17" class="apex">17</a> a decision that triggered international condemnation, as well as criticism from state and local governments and large corporations in the <span class="place">United States</span>. In August 2017, the <span class="organization">United States</span> notified the <span class="organization">United Nations</span> of its intent to withdraw from the <span class="reference">Paris Agreement</span> as soon as the <span class="organization">United States</span> is eligible, unless it <q>identifies suitable terms for reengagement.</q><a href="#18" class="apex">18</a> The <span class="organization">U.S.</span> withdrawal was characterized as a <q>severe backwards move and an abrogation of its responsibility as the world’s second largest emitter . . . when more, not less, commitment is needed from all governments to avert the worst impacts of climate change.</q><a href="#19" class="apex">19</a> Despite this withdrawal, however, the <span class="organization">United States</span> could meet its Paris goals through the efforts of cities, states, and businesses.<a href="#20" class="apex">20</a></p>

				<p>The global crisis of climate change has affected the practice of law.<a href="#21" class="apex">21</a> Indeed, in recent years, climate change has engendered <q>a rapidly building wave of litigation</q> in the <span class="place">United States</span>.<a href="#22" class="apex">22</a> Although the judiciary is <q>a latecomer to the crisis that has worsened in the hands of the legislative and executive branches,</q><a href="#23" class="apex">23</a> litigation can play a role in forcing government regulatory action and perhaps in providing remedies for harm from GHG emissions. As commentators observed, <q>[t]he president might root out climate policy from executive branch decision-making, but he cannot unilaterally remove the issue from judicial consideration.</q><a href="#24" class="apex">24</a></p>

				<p>This Report, guided by a questionnaire prepared for the <span class="event">Twentieth General Congress of the International Academy of Comparative Law</span>, addresses the topic of climate change lawsuits and the individual. The questionnaire focuses on lawsuits filed by individual plaintiffs against public and private actors to achieve mitigation of climate change or adaptation to its effects. It does not focus on legal persons, such as corporations and other legal entities. Of the hundreds of climate change cases filed in the United States, only a small number involve individual plaintiffs. Other cases involve environmental organizations that sue on behalf of their members, demanding mitigation or adaptation and sometimes damages for injury. To provide background, this Report first reviews possible causes of action to remedy climate change. It raises a number of difficult issues faced by plaintiffs in climate change litigation. The Report then reviews a number of cases brought by individual plaintiffs and environmental organizations against public and private actors.</p>

				<h2>I. Climate Change Causes of Action: A Brief Overview</h2>
				<p>Climate change litigation, defined broadly, is <q>any piece of federal, state, tribal, or local administrative or judicial litigation in which the party filings or tribunal decisions directly and expressly raise an issue of fact or law regarding the substance or policy of climate change causes and impacts.</q><a href="#25" class="apex">25</a> An empirical study identified 201 U.S. agency proceedings and court cases involving climate change up to 2010.<a href="#26" class="apex">26</a> Two types of issues were predominant: government agency responsibility to restrict GHG emission by rule or permit and government compliance with statutory requirements for environmental impact assessment in decisions to approve GHG sources.<a href="#27" class="apex">27</a> Most climate change litigation asked courts to decide <q>whether and how administrative agencies must take climate change into account in decisionmaking under existing statutes.</q><a href="#28" class="apex">28</a></p>

				<p>The “wave of litigation” continued, and by April 2018, a database of U.S. climate change litigation listed 857 “cases,” broadly defined.<a href="#29" class="apex">29</a> This database, linking to more than 3,094 documents, collects a wide variety of court cases, administrative actions, petitions for rulemaking, and other matters related to climate change. In some of the court cases in the database, climate change is not the main focus of the litigation. Claims represented in these cases arose under federal and state statutes, the Constitution, common law, public trust, securities and financial regulation, and trade agreements; a few cases involved climate change protesters and scientists.<a href="#30" class="apex">30</a></p>

				<h3>A. Regulatory Litigation</h3>
				<p>A significant number of <span class="place">U.S.</span> climate change cases are based on federal statutes and regulations, and many seek judicial review of administrative decisions. Both industry and environmentalists have sued. Industry cases often challenge government regulatory environmental standards. Suits by environmentalists often seek more stringent regulation for mitigation or adaptation. Under the <span class="reference">Clean Air Act</span>, for example, environmentalist suits include petitions to require agency rulemaking or other climate-related action and various challenges to administrative actions such as the granting of permits. Other cases challenge agency decisions under the <span class="reference">National Environmental Policy Act</span><a href="#31" class="apex">31</a> and other federal laws for failure to consider GHG emissions and the impact of climate change. Some of these climate change lawsuits have led to stricter regulation—for example, <span class="organization">EPA</span> regulation of greenhouse gas emissions after <span class="event">Massachusetts v. EPA.</span><a href="#32" class="apex">32</a></p>

				<p>State law claims, too, challenge administrative decisions, with environmental plaintiffs often seeking stronger regulation or challenging permits. Even more state law cases allege inadequate consideration of GHG emissions and climate change under state environmental impact laws. Cases that challenge inadequate adaptation measures sometimes rely on statutory and regulatory requirements or, in local cases, on local government ordinances.</p>

				<h3>B. Common Law</h3>
				<p>Although climate change litigation based on various federal and state statutes has predominated, a few plaintiffs have brought common law causes of action, albeit with little success.<a href="#33" class="apex">33</a> Most are tort claims for damages, and scholars have expressed views on the most effective causes of action in climate change lawsuits. Nuisance and negligence offer some possibility for success, with trespass and civil conspiracy considered less helpful. Strict liability is another possible remedy,<a href="#34" class="apex">34</a> and some cases rely on public trust.</p>

				<p>Nuisance law, with its focus on unreasonable injury, may be effective for some climate change claims.<a href="#35" class="apex">35</a> Public nuisance lawsuits are appropriate to abate <q>an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.</q><a href="#36" class="apex">36</a> <span class="reference">American Electric Power, Co. v. Connecticut</span>,<a href="#37" class="apex">37</a> however, limited federal common law public nuisance claims in areas governed by statute, holding that <q>the <span class="reference">Clean Air Act</span> and the <span class="organization">EPA</span> actions it authorizes displace any federal common law right to seek abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants.</q><a href="#38" class="apex">38</a> Common law nuisance claims based on state common law may continue to be viable.<a href="#39" class="apex">39</a></p>

				<p>Relatively few plaintiffs have sued in negligence, but some commentators see negligence as the most appropriate tort cause of action.<a href="#40" class="apex">40</a> Typical requirements for a prima facie case in negligence—duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages—raise significant challenges in cases against GHG emitters, especially in proving that emissions breached a duty to plaintiffs and that defendant’s emissions caused plaintiff’s injury. Negligence may be more successful in adaptation cases against local governments or property developers, but proving that the defendant’s alleged negligence, rather than an extreme precipitation event, was proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm may be difficult.<a href="#41" class="apex">41</a></p>

				<p>Despite the existence of some climate change tort cases, tort law may not be an effective means to mitigate or adapt to climate change. As one influential scholar insisted, <q>climate change ill fits the existing tort paradigm.</q><a href="#42" class="apex">42</a> Specifically, this scholar explained:</br>

					<q>Diffuse and disparate in origin, lagged and latticed in effect, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions represent the paradigmatic anti-tort, a collective action problem so pervasive and so complicated as to render at once both all of us and none of us responsible. Thus, courts will have ample reason—not to mention doctrinal weaponry—to prevent climate change tort suits from reaching a jury.<a href="#43" class="apex">43</a></q>
				</p>

				<p>Others agree that tort law is intended to solve private and local disputes, rather than big societal problems:</br>

					<q>Climate change and other so-called “collective action” problems simply cannot be addressed through the common-law tort system. That system was developed to address essentially private disputes, involving lines of fault and causation running directly between discrete parties. It was never intended, and cannot reasonably be applied, to allow a judge or jury to assess and allocate liability for any and all societal concerns.<a href="#44" class="apex">44</a></q>
				</p>

				<p>Legislatures, instead of courts, have <q>the authority and the capacity to consider and develop responses to [climate change], and only after a regulatory architecture has been established can judges and juries properly (and constitutionally) play a role.</q><a href="#45" class="apex">45</a></p>

				<h3>C. Public Trust</h3>
				<p>Beginning around 2011, plaintiffs have filed a number of cases relying, at least in part, on the public trust doctrine.<a href="#46" class="apex">46</a> Some are part of a global campaign, the <span class="reference">Atmospheric Trust Litigation</span>, connected with a nonprofit, <span class="organization">Our Children’s Trust</span>.<a href="#47" class="apex">47</a> Public trust, with roots in Roman and English law, requires governments to protect certain natural resources, <q>the gifts of nature’s bounty,</q> for present and future generations.<a href="#48" class="apex">48</a> Although the precise source of public trust in U.S. law is hard to identify, the doctrine is an ancient attribute of federal and state sovereignty with constitutional force.<a href="#49" class="apex">49</a></p>

				<p>Plaintiffs (primarily young people) in recent public trust litigation insist that the government owes a fiduciary obligation to its citizen beneficiaries to protect public trust assets, including the atmosphere and water bodies affected by GHG emissions. State public trust law is evolving and may help to address climate change. A few courts have recognized the atmosphere as a public trust asset, and a few decisions have resulted in a court-ordered state GHG rulemaking.<a href="#50" class="apex">50</a> Sixteen states have ecological public trusts; five have indicated that their doctrines are evolutionary, responding to changing environmental circumstances; and two have explicitly extended public trust to the atmosphere.<a href="#51" class="apex">51</a> It is possible, therefore, that adaptation to climate change could <q>become an official state duty, geared to protecting as much of the public interest in and rights to natural resources and ecosystems as possible in light of climate change impacts.</q><a href="#52" class="apex">52</a></p>

				<p>Some scholars urge the use of judicial restraint to limit climate change litigation, relying perhaps on standing and the political question doctrine.<a href="#53" class="apex">53</a> Climate change, it is argued, is <q>a massive global and undifferentiated problem is one that must be addressed by the political branches of government—Congress and the EPA—and ultimately by international bodies.</q><a href="#54" class="apex">54</a> Nonetheless, litigants have turned to the courts for relief from harm caused by GHG emissions.</p>

				<h2>II. Significant Issues in Climate Change Litigation</h2>
				<p><span class="organization">Courts</span>, in general, accept the science of climate change<a href="#55" class="apex">55</a> and conclusions from the <span class="organization">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span> and others that anthropogenic emissions of GHGs are a major cause of climate change.<a href="#56" class="apex">56</a> The majority opinion in <span class="reference">Massachusetts v. EPA</span>, decided in 2007, illustrates:</br>

					<q>A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related. For when carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it acts like the ceiling of a greenhouse, trapping solar energy and retarding the escape of reflected heat. It is therefore a species—the most important species—of a “greenhouse gas.<a href="#57" class="apex">57</a></q>	
				</p>

				<p>Despite judicial acceptance of the science, climate change litigation raises a number of issues. Some arise in nearly all climate change litigation; others apply to specific types of lawsuits, depending on the cause of action and the parties. The following discussion focuses on major issues common to cases brought to mitigate or abate the effects of climate change. It does not attempt to identify every possible defense or obstacle facing plaintiffs in climate change cases.<a href="#58" class="apex">58</a></p>

				<h3>A. Standing</h3>
				<p>Under <span class="reference">Article III of the U.S. Constitution</span>,<a href="#59" class="apex">59</a> which limits federal judicial authority to cases and controversies, plaintiffs who sue in federal court must have standing to sue; state courts also require standing. The doctrine of standing helps to ensure that the plaintiff has a personal stake in the controversy and that issues will be resolved in a <q>proper adversarial presentation.</q><a href="#60" class="apex">60</a></p>

				<p>The <span class="organization">U.S. Supreme Court</span> articulated the elements of standing in an environmental law decision:</br>

					<q>[T]o satisfy Article III’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.<a href="#61" class="apex">61</a></q>
				</p>

				<p>The injury required for standing is injury to the plaintiff, rather than to the environment.<a href="#62" class="apex">62</a> Only one plaintiff must have standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the court,<a href="#63" class="apex">63</a> and the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing.<a href="#64" class="apex">64</a></p>

				<p>Nongovernmental and other organizations often bring climate change lawsuits on behalf of their members. These associations, the <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> noted, have standing if <q>members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organization’s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.</q><a href="#65" class="apex">65</a></p>

				<p>The plaintiff’s injury in fact must be particularized and imminent. The <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> noted that <q>[b]y particularized, we mean that the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.</q><a href="#66" class="apex">66</a> Some scholars have noted that plaintiffs must allege harms that are more than <q>generalized grievances shared by all citizens.</q><a href="#67" class="apex">67</a> On a global scale, however, climate change <q>defies any notion of particularized injury.</q><a href="#68" class="apex">68</a> The fact that harms from climate change are widespread may lead courts to conclude that those harms are generalized grievances, but in a leading standing decision, <span class="reference">Massachusetts v. EPA</span>, the <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> indicated that widely shared risks do not minimize the plaintiff’s interest in the outcome of litigation.<a href="#69" class="apex">69</a></p>

				<p>The plaintiff’s injury must be <q>fairly traceable</q> to defendant’s action. That is, the plaintiff must identify a causal connection between defendant’s behavior and injury caused by climate change. Given the nature of GHGs, plaintiffs are unlikely to identify a direct causal connection to a source of emissions.<a href="#70" class="apex">70</a> As the <span class="organization">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</span> indicated, the analysis of traceability in climate change cases might use <q>the standard by which a public nuisance action imposes liability on contributors to an indivisible harm,</q><a href="#71" class="apex">71</a> a standard short of scientific certainty or proof of proximate cause, thus allowing <q>a substantial likelihood of causal contribution [to satisfy] the test of traceability</q> for standing.<a href="#72" class="apex">72</a></p>

				<p>Redressability can also pose difficulties for plaintiffs: <q>If redressability requires successful elimination of the entire climate change problem, then no plausible suit could ever clear the standing hurdle.</q><a href="#73" class="apex">73</a> Focus on redressing the harm suffered by the plaintiff makes satisfying this element more likely. As the <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> noted in <span class="place">Massachusetts</span>, climate change has enormous consequences; the plaintiff must allege that the requested remedy would slow or reduce global warming, but not that a favorable decision can relieve every injury.<a href="#74" class="apex">74</a></p>

				<p>Two types of climate change cases illustrate issues of standing. One involves a challenge to government failure to consider the impacts of climate change in making decisions under the <span class="reference">National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)</span>,<a href="#75" class="apex">75</a> the <span class="reference">Endangered Species Act (ESA)</span>,<a href="#76" class="apex">76</a> or other statutes. The other involves claims that the <span class="reference">Clean Air Act</span><a href="#77" class="apex">77</a> or other statutes require the government to take more regulatory action to mitigate climate change.<a href="#78" class="apex">78</a></p>

				<p>Some federal statutes, most prominently the <span class="reference">NEPA</span>,<a href="#79" class="apex">79</a> require the government to assess the environmental impacts of certain actions that affect the environment. Some courts denied standing to petitioners who challenged government failure to consider climate change in environmental assessments, in part because the effects of a proposed project were remote, rather than actual and imminent, and because their alleged harm (increased global temperature) was not particularized.<a href="#80" class="apex">80</a> More recently, in <span class="event">WildEarth Guardians v. Jewell</span>,<a href="#81" class="apex">81</a> the <span class="organization">D.C. Circuit</span> granted standing to plaintiffs who established <q>that consideration of climate change would have impacted the decision that allegedly harms them, even if the harm is not itself related to climate change.</q><a href="#82" class="apex">82</a> Plaintiffs’ aesthetic and recreational interests supported standing, and their challenge to the failure to consider climate change could be litigated along with other issues in the case.<a href="#83" class="apex">83</a> Indeed when plaintiffs allege that their procedural rights are violated (e.g., failure to consider climate change in a decision that results in harm to environmental interests), they may <q>tend to fare better when they can articulate an underlying injury for standing purposes that is not itself climate based.</q><a href="#84" class="apex">84</a></p>

				<p>Standing is relevant when a plaintiff challenges the government’s failure to regulate GHG emissions under federal pollution control statutes. Standing was a threshold issue in <span class="reference">Massachusetts v. EPA</span>.<a href="#85" class="apex">85</a> States, local governments, and private organizations alleged that the <span class="organization">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</span> had <q>abdicated its responsibility under the <span class="reference">Clean Air Act (CAA)</span> to regulate the emissions of four greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide</q> from new motor vehicles.<a href="#86" class="apex">86</a> Petitioners asked the <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> to determine whether the <span class="organization">EPA</span> had statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions and whether the <span class="organization">EPA</span>’s reasons for failing to regulate were consistent with the <span class="reference">CAA</span>. In its standing determination, the Court recognized that GHG emissions caused widespread harm, but held that the state of <span class="place">Massachusetts</span> satisfied the constitutional requirements for standing. <span class="organization">Massachusetts</span>, as landowner and parens patriae for its citizens, faced injury from the risk of rising sea levels that could swallow coastal land. In terms of causation, carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles contributed significantly to GHG concentrations. The regulation of those carbon dioxide emissions would help to redress the injury suffered by <span class="place">Massachusetts</span> and its citizens.<a href="#87" class="apex">87</a></p>

				<p>The <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> decision in <span class="place">Massachusetts</span> was solicitous of states as plaintiffs, but some argue that the decision <q>weakened the traditional requirements for <span class="reference">Article III</span> standing,</q><a href="#88" class="apex">88</a> especially causation and redressability. As one scholar suggested, private plaintiffs could cite the Court’s reasoning to support standing in similar cases involving injury from rising sea levels due to climate change, but subsequent cases have been “confusing” on standing.<a href="#89" class="apex">89</a> Nonetheless, standing decisions are difficult (and “often logically suspect”) in cases where the claim is that “a government action or inaction permits or leaves unregulated some activity” that contributes to climate change and its harm.<a href="#90" class="apex">90</a></p>

				<h3>B. The Political Question Doctrine</h3>
				<p>The political question doctrine is, in a sense, a separation of powers issue, which applies in a federal law context. That is, it holds that certain types of issues are <q>committed to an elected branch of government and thus should not be heard in federal court.</q><a href="#91" class="apex">91</a> The political question doctrine might be considered an aspect of prudential standing, beyond the requirements for <span class="reference">Article III</span> standing, that can <q>ensure respect for the separation of powers.</q><a href="#92" class="apex">92</a></p>

				<p>In <span class="event">Baker v. Carr</span>, a leading political question decision, the <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> articulated six attributes of a nonjusticiable political question and indicated that only if one of those attributes is <q>inextricable</q> from the dispute should the court dismiss the case as a political question.<a href="#93" class="apex">93</a> The Court indicated that cases that involve political actions or issues are not normally nonjusticiable political questions. Indeed, few <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> cases have been found to present political questions.<a href="#94" class="apex">94</a></p>

				<p>In the climate change context, the political question doctrine was analyzed in trial and appellate decisions in <span class="event">Connecticut v. American Electric Power</span>, a case involving federal common law nuisance claims seeking abatement of carbon dioxide emissions from electric power corporations. The federal district court in New York noted that climate change was <q>patently political</q> and <q>transcendently legislative.</q> It focused especially on a <span class="event">Baker v. Carr</span> attribute, <q>the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,</q> and determined that it needed a legislative policy determination before it could decide the global warming complaints. The district court therefore dismissed the case as raising nonjusticiable political questions.<a href="#95" class="apex">95</a> On appeal, the Second Circuit applied the <span class="event">Baker v. Carr</span> factors, analyzing each factor in detail, and concluding that none of the factors applied. The dispute was not inherently political, and the court could hear a public nuisance suit. Therefore, the Second Circuit reversed.<a href="#96" class="apex">96</a> The <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> granted certiorari, but did not reach the political question issue. Instead, the Court held that the <span class="reference">Clean Air Act</span>, which authorizes the <span class="organization">EPA</span> to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, displaced plaintiffs’ federal common law nuisance claims.<a href="#97" class="apex">97</a></p>

				<p>In a more recent case alleging violation of constitutional and public trust rights, a federal district court analyzed plaintiffs’ claims in light of the six criteria in <span class="event">Baker v. Carr</span>. The court concluded that the case did not raise a nonjusticiable political question, but involved a determination of whether plaintiffs’ constitutional rights had been violated. The court acknowledged, however, that if plaintiffs prevail, a remedy would have to be crafted carefully to avoid separation of powers issues.<a href="#98" class="apex">98</a></p>

				<p>Some scholars urge the use of judicial restraint, using standing and the political question doctrine, to dismiss tort litigation in the context of climate change.<a href="#99" class="apex">99</a> But the political question doctrine does not apply often, and others believe that it was not intended to apply to nonconstitutional issues or, if it applies, should not preclude review of common law claims. That is, <q>courts should not hide from these issues behind the veil of the political question doctrine.</q><a href="#100" class="apex">100</a></p>

				<h3>C. Displacement</h3>
				<p>The doctrine of displacement, a separation of powers issue between the judicial and legislative branches,<a href="#101" class="apex">101</a> has prevented the resolution of some prominent climate change cases based on federal common law. A leading displacement decision is <span class="reference">American Electric Power, Co. v. Connecticut (AEP)</span>,<a href="#102" class="apex">102</a> a federal common law public nuisance claim for injunctive relief, alleging that GHG emissions from power companies contributed to global warming. Federal common law applies only when Congress had not regulated, and <span class="event">Massachusetts v. EPA</span><a href="#103" class="apex">103</a> had held that the <span class="reference">CAA</span> authorized federal regulation of GHG emissions. The <span class="organization">EPA</span> had issued its <q>endangerment</q> finding<a href="#104" class="apex">104</a> and had begun the regulatory process. Therefore, the Court held <q>that the <span class="reference">Clean Air Act</span> and the <span class="organization">EPA</span> actions it authorizes displace any federal common law right to seek abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants.</q><a href="#105" class="apex">105</a> The test for displacement of federal common law is <q>whether the statute ‘speak[s] directly to [the] question’ at issue.</q><a href="#106" class="apex">106</a> Congressional delegation of authority to the <span class="organization">EPA</span> to regulate (or not to regulate) emissions displaced federal common law, even before the <span class="organization">EPA</span> promulgated regulations. The court stated clearly, however, that <q>EPA’s judgment . . . would not escape judicial review</q> through administrative law challenges in the federal courts.<a href="#107" class="apex">107</a></p>

				<q>Although plaintiffs in <span class="event">AEP v. Connecticut</span> sought injunctive relief, later cases indicated that displacement does not depend on the type of remedy. For example, <span class="event">Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil</span><a href="#108" class="apex">108</a> was a federal public nuisance claim against energy producers for money damages brought by an Alaskan village threatened by erosion from storm waves and surges attributed to global warming. Although federal common law nuisance could apply to transboundary pollution, the <span class="organization">Ninth Circuit</span> stated that common law <q>is subject to the paramount authority of <span class="organization">Congress</span>,</q><a href="#109" class="apex">109</a> and that displacement of the common law right of action displaces all its remedies. Therefore, the court held, <q><span class="organization">AEP</span> extinguished <span class="place">Kivalina</span>’s federal common law public nuisance damage action,</q> just as it had extinguished the abatement actions at issue in <span class="organization">AEP</span>.<a href="#110" class="apex">110</a> The court’s conclusion was not affected by the fact that <span class="place">Kivalina</span> sought damages for harms that occurred before the <span class="organization">EPA</span> established GHG standards. Congressional empowerment of the <span class="organization">EPA</span> triggered displacement, which applies even if the executive branch has not yet acted under its congressional authority.</q>

				<p><span class="event">AEP v. Connecticut</span> focused on federal common law, but did not reach the plaintiff’s state law claims. The Court noted, however, that <q>the availability . . . of a state lawsuit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the federal</q> <span class="reference">CAA</span>.<a href="#111" class="apex">111</a> Preemption requires a <q>clear and manifest [congressional] purpose</q><a href="#112" class="apex">112</a> and is generally disfavored. Nonetheless, the complications of climate change cases mean that the <span class="organization">EPA</span> can more efficiently regulate GHG emissions.<a href="#113" class="apex">113</a></p>

				<q>Recent cases allege harm to public trust assets, including the atmosphere and territorial seas. Public trust claims were not at issue in <span class="event">AEP v. Connecticut</span>, and so far, the displacement doctrine has not been applied to public trust claims. Characterized as substantive due process claims, these public trust rights, which predate and are secured by the Constitution, are unique because the government obligation to protect the trust property <q>cannot be legislated away.</q><a href="#114" class="apex">114</a></q>

				<h3>D. Causation and Problems of Proof</h3>
				<p>As a threshold determination, standing requires a causal connection between the defendant’s conduct and the plaintiff’s injury, which must be <q>fairly traceable</q> to defendant’s action.<a href="#115" class="apex">115</a> On the merits, however, proof of causation may be a significant barrier to recovery, particularly in tort cases claiming damages for injuries caused by climate change. Plaintiffs must generally prove the connection between the defendant’s GHG emissions and plaintiff’s harm, as well as the extent of defendant’s contribution to that harm.</p>

				<p>The nature of climate change raises significant evidentiary problems. GHGs come from many sources; some have persisted in the atmosphere, and others are present-day emissions. Some emissions come directly from industry; others, less direct, come when many individuals burn fossil fuels. In fact, <q>the <span class="organization">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span> describes the key causal mechanism of climate change as ‘well-mixed greenhouse gases’ in the atmosphere. Such mixing obscures particular contributions and makes attribution of harm difficult. Yet the law generally assigns liability only when particular contributions can be related to particular effects.</q><a href="#116" class="apex">116</a></p>

				<p>Therefore, plaintiffs in climate change cases will face <q>enormous difficulties</q> in proving causation, especially <q>that emissions from a particular site, or group of sites, actually made their way into the atmosphere, and once there contributed to climate change, which then caused a specific event . . . and that provable damages ensued.</q><a href="#117" class="apex">117</a> A 2017 international study asserted that <q>no court has yet found that particular GHG emissions relate causally to particular adverse climate change impacts for the purpose of establishing liability.</q><a href="#118" class="apex">118</a> Moreover, plaintiffs face the additional burden of proving that defendant’s GHG emissions were a substantial factor in their particularized damages.<a href="#119" class="apex">119</a> Apportionment of damages among numerous sources of GHGs will raise particular challenges.<a href="#120" class="apex">120</a></p>

				<p>Some tort causes of action (negligence, negligent nuisance) require proof that the defendant’s actions were unreasonable. Defendants who operated under a valid government permit or whose GHG emissions were not regulated may have acted reasonably. Moreover, in negligence cases, plaintiffs may not meet the requirement of proximate cause if, for example, flood damage was caused by extreme rainfall, rather than breach of duty by the defendant.<a href="#121" class="apex">121</a> Intentional torts (intentional nuisance, trespass) require proof that the defendant knew of the resulting harm or was <q>substantially certain</q> that harm would result from the defendant’s actions.<a href="#122" class="apex">122</a></p>

				<p>When plaintiffs claim damages from climate change, difficulties in proving causation and other issues and in collecting a substantial portion of damages mean that the <q>financial viability of these cases from a plaintiff’s perspective in many instances is highly questionable.</q><a href="#123" class="apex">123</a></p>

				<p>Problems of proof faced by climate change plaintiffs are often due to <q>gaps or uncertainties in relevant climate science,</q> in part because scientific studies have focused on large-scale effects, rather than more local impacts.<a href="#124" class="apex">124</a> Advances in scientific research may make proof of causation easier, allowing plaintiffs to identify defendants and to apportion their responsibility more accurately.<a href="#125" class="apex">125</a> An article published in 2014, for example, noted that climate change is the result of historic emissions and traced emissions to major carbon producers. The study, based on records from 1854 to 2010, found that 63% of cumulative global emissions of industrial CO2 and methane originated from ninety international <q>carbon major</q> entities (companies, state-owned enterprises, and nations).<a href="#126" class="apex">126</a> For some cases, studies like this could make apportionment of damages easier.</p>

				<h2>III. The Individual as Plaintiff in Climate Change Litigation</h2>
				<p>In the <span class="place">United States</span>, individuals have the right to comment on regulatory proposals and participate in administrative agency proceedings. Moreover, many statutes have citizen-suit provisions that allow individuals and others affected by statutory or regulatory violations to sue for violations, sometimes after giving notice to the agency. Plaintiffs must generally meet the threshold requirements discussed above. Few individuals, however, have the resources for costly, protracted litigation against governments or private actors.<a href="#127" class="apex">127</a> Instead, plaintiffs in climate change litigation tend to be environmental organizations and associations. The following discussion therefore includes some cases brought by environmental organizations.</p>

				<h3>A. Human Rights and Public Trust</h3>
				<p>Although climate change threatens people globally and in the <span class="place">United States</span>, few climate change cases in the United States have focused on human rights. In 2005, the <span class="organization">Inuit community</span> in <span class="place">Alaska</span> petitioned the <span class="organization">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</span>, claiming that <span class="organization">U.S.</span> failure to control GHGs had violated Inuit human rights. The Commission did not decide the case, but the Inuit petition helped to highlight <q>the human rights implications of climate change.</q><a href="#128" class="apex">128</a></p>

				<p>In recent years, public trust litigation, often in state courts, has raised human rights claims, with mixed success.<a href="#129" class="apex">129</a> These cases, many brought by young people under the auspices of <span class="organization">Our Children’s Trust</span>, allege that public trust requires government action on climate change. Using petitions for rulemaking, often seeking carbon recovery plans, as well as lawsuits, they form <q>a full-scale, coordinated campaign with multiple suits pending and others teed up in different forums, all connected by a common template of science and law.</q><a href="#130" class="apex">130</a> Most petitions and lawsuits have been unsuccessful, but a few have led to regulatory action.<a href="#131" class="apex">131</a> Successful atmospheric trust litigation requires the court to recognize its judicial role in enforcing public trust obligations, identifying government obligations to protect the atmosphere as a public trust asset, and crafting remedies that will <q>ensure that the political branches fulfill their trust obligation.</q><a href="#132" class="apex">132</a></p>

				<p>A federal case filed in <span class="place">Oregon</span> illustrates the efforts of individual plaintiffs to gain acceptance of the public trust doctrine in the context of climate change. Plaintiffs in <span class="event">Juliana v. United States</span><a href="#133" class="apex">133</a> are twenty-one young people, one adult (guardian for future generations), and <span class="organization">Earth Guardians</span>, a youth association with a chapter in <span class="place">Oregon</span>. They sued the <span class="organization">United States</span>, the President, and executive agencies, alleging that defendants knew for decades that burning fossil fuels destabilized the climate system, but nonetheless enabled exploitation and use of fossil fuels, allowing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere to escalate.</p>

				<p>Because the <span class="reference">U.S. Constitution</span> does not explicitly protect the environment, plaintiffs in <span class="place">Juliana</span> alleged that defendants’ actions <q>violate their substantive due process rights to life, liberty, and property, and that defendants have violated their obligation to hold certain natural resources in trust for the people and for future generations.</q><a href="#134" class="apex">134</a> They sought a declaration that their rights had been violated and an order enjoining continued violation and requiring preparation of a plan to reduce emissions of CO2. Defendants and intervenors moved to dismiss, asserting, among other claims, that the case raised political questions, plaintiffs lacked standing, the federal government is not subject to public trust claims. The judge’s thoughtful opinion affirmed and supplemented the magistrate judge’s denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>

				<p>The judge identified the questions at issue: <q>[W]hether defendants are responsible for some of the harm caused by climate change, whether plaintiffs may challenge defendants’ climate change policy in court, and whether this Court can direct defendants to change their policy without running afoul of the separation of powers doctrine.</q><a href="#135" class="apex">135</a></p>

				<p>On the political question issue, the court analyzed the case in light of the <span class="organization">Supreme Court</span> criteria<a href="#136" class="apex">136</a> and concluded that the case did not raise a nonjusticiable political question, but instead involved a determination of <q>whether defendants have violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.</q><a href="#137" class="apex">137</a> Moreover, plaintiffs met constitutional requirements for standing. They alleged particularized and imminent injuries, which are ongoing and likely to recur.<a href="#138" class="apex">138</a> Plaintiffs’ injuries are fairly traceable to defendant’s actions and are redressable because the relief requested (a remedial plan to phase out emissions and reduce CO2) will help to slow climate change.<a href="#139" class="apex">139</a></p>

				<p>The court then evaluated plaintiffs’ due process and public trust claims. Applying a strict scrutiny standard, because of possible infringement of a fundamental right, the court noted that <q>the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society.</q><a href="#140" class="apex">140</a> The court held that <q>where a complaint alleges governmental action is affirmatively and substantially damaging the climate system in a way that will cause human deaths, shorten human lifespans, result in widespread damage to property, threaten human food sources, and dramatically alter the planet’s ecosystem, it states a claim for a due process violation.</q><a href="#141" class="apex">141</a> The court evaluated the plaintiffs’ claim of harm to public trust assets and held that the doctrine applies to the federal government. Unlike common law nuisance claims, <span class="event">AEP v. Connecticut</span> did not displace public trust, and those claims, characterized as substantive due process claims, can be heard in federal court.<a href="#142" class="apex">142</a></p>

				<p>Perhaps recognizing the novelty of her decision, the judge commented that <q>[f]ederal courts too often have been cautious and overly deferential in the arena of environmental law, and the world has suffered for it.</q><a href="#143" class="apex">143</a> Defendants moved for an interlocutory appeal, but in June 2017, the district court denied defendants’ motion.<a href="#144" class="apex">144</a> The <span class="organization">United States</span> filed a writ of mandamus in the <span class="organization">Ninth Circuit</span>, arguing in part, that

					<q>[t]he District Court’s rulings in this case show a clear and continuing intent to usurp the power of Congress to determine national policy regarding energy development, use of public lands and environmental protection by constructing out of whole cloth a novel constitutional right to a <q>climate system capable of sustaining human life.<a href="#145" class="apex">145</a></q>
				</p>

				<p>The <span class="organization">Ninth Circuit</span> stayed the district court proceedings until further order and heard oral arguments on December 11, 2017.<a href="#146" class="apex">146</a></p>

				<p>Juliana is the first federal court decision holding that <q>there might be a constitutional right to a sound environment,</q> but it seems unlikely, according to a climate law scholar, that the plaintiffs will ultimately prevail.<a href="#147" class="apex">147</a> Indeed, the <span class="organization">D.C. Circuit</span> affirmed the dismissal of a suit against federal defendants because public trust was a matter of state law.<a href="#148" class="apex">148</a> Similarly, cases in state courts may be unsuccessful. For example, a <span class="place">New Mexico</span> state court rejected application of the public trust with a separation of powers rationale.<a href="#149" class="apex">149</a> An individual plaintiff and a conservation organization alleged that the public trust obligated the government to regulate GHG emissions. The <span class="organization">New Mexico Court of Appeals</span> held that the state constitution includes a public trust duty to protect natural resources, including the atmosphere, but that public trust arguments <q>must be raised within the existing constitutional and statutory framework,</q> rather than by a common law action.<a href="#150" class="apex">150</a> The <span class="reference">Air Quality Control Act</span> addresses regulation of GHGs and allows plaintiffs the right to participate in the administrative process, so courts cannot independently regulate GHG emissions. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court’s summary judgment for the state.</p>

				<h3>B. Mitigation Cases v. Public Actors</h3>
				<p>Many federal and state cases seek mitigation of climate change. Some (for example, <span class="organization">Massachusetts</span>) demand regulatory action; others demand consideration of GHG emissions and climate change in governmental decision making.<a href="#151" class="apex">151</a> Industry cases against public actors often challenge regulatory measures to mitigate climate change.<a href="#152" class="apex">152</a></p>

				<p>Two state-court cases brought by youth plaintiffs as part of atmospheric trust litigation illustrate individual-plaintiff lawsuits against public actors for mitigation. In both, plaintiffs sought review of environmental agency denials of petitions for rulemaking. In one, the court required GHG regulations; in the other, the trial court required regulations and recognized plaintiff’s public trust and constitutional rights, but its order was reversed on appeal.</p>

				<p>In <span class="event">Kain v. Department of Environmental Protection</span>, individual state residents and two associations sought a declaratory judgment or writ of mandamus to require the Department to regulate GHG emissions as required by <span class="place">Massachusetts</span> law.<a href="#153" class="apex">153</a> After petitioning the Department, which cited regulatory initiatives and asserted that it had complied with the law, state residents sued. The trial court dismissed plaintiff’s claims, and the <span class="organization">Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts</span> granted review and concluded that the Department had not complied with statutory requirements. Therefore, the court required the Department

					<q>to promulgate regulations that address multiple sources or categories of sources of greenhouse gas emissions, impose a limit on emissions that may be released, limit the aggregate emissions released from each group of regulated resources or categories of sources, set emission limits for each year, and set limits that decline on an annual basis.<a href="#154" class="apex">154</a></q>
				</p>

				<p><span class="event">Foster v. Washington Department of Ecology</span><a href="#155" class="apex">155</a> was a public-trust challenge to the <span class="organization">Washington Department of Ecology</span>’s denial of a 2014 petition for a rule to propose science-based GHG emission limits to the legislature. In June 2015, the court ordered the <span class="organization">Department of Ecology (DOE)</span> to reconsider its denial of plaintiffs’ petition, especially in light of the <span class="organization">DOE</span>’s own report, which the court characterized as an <q>urgent call to action</q> on climate change, that emphasized the importance of prompt action on climate change, but failed to recommend stricter emission limits.<a href="#156" class="apex">156</a> In November 2015, the court affirmed the <span class="organization">DOE</span>’s second denial of the plaintiffs’ petition because rulemaking had begun, but emphasized the state and DOE duty to protect public trust and other rights under the Washington state constitution.<a href="#157" class="apex">157</a> In May 2016, however, after the <span class="organization">DOE</span>’s rulemaking lagged, the judge ordered the <span class="organization">DOE</span> to finalize its rule and make recommendations for GHG emission reductions to the legislature.<a href="#158" class="apex">158</a> <span class="organization">The Department of Ecology</span> appealed this order.<a href="#159" class="apex">159</a></p>

				<p>By the end of 2016, the <span class="organization">DOE</span> had issued its GHG rule and recommended GHG emission limitations to the legislature. Nonetheless, in a December 2016 opinion, the trial court judge, sua sponte, granted petitioners leave to amend their complaint to add a complaint for declaratory judgment that that <span class="organization">DOE</span> is violating their inalienable constitutional and public-trust rights to a healthy environment. The court retained jurisdiction of the case to give the plaintiffs their day in court.<a href="#160" class="apex">160</a> In another order, the court took <q>judicial notice of the fact that federal mechanisms designed to protect the environment are now under siege, more than ever leaving to the States the obligation to protect their citizens under the Public Trust Doctrine.</q><a href="#161" class="apex">161</a> In September 2017, the <span class="organization">Washington Court of Appeals</span> reversed the trial court’s May 2016 order as an abuse of discretion.<a href="#162" class="apex">162</a></p>

				<p>The trial court’s approach in Foster is significant because of its recognition of the crisis of climate change, its declaration of public-trust protection of the atmosphere, and its emphasis on the importance of science for rulemaking.<a href="#163" class="apex">163</a> In Foster, the judge <q>declared an atmospheric public trust responsibility of constitutional magnitude in a context framed by urgency, severe danger to humanity, and agency recalcitrance.</q><a href="#164" class="apex">164</a></p>

				<h3>C. Climate Change in Environmental Impact Assessment</h3>
				<h4>Federal Law</h4>
				<p>A significant number of U.S. cases (more than 300) focus on government responsibility to consider the impact of GHG emissions and climate change in decision making. Federal cases rely on the <span class="reference">NEPA</span>, the <span class="reference">ESA</span>,<a href="#165" class="apex">165</a> and other statutes; state cases rely on state impact assessment laws. In an analysis of litigation through 2010, researchers found <q>a fairly well defined case law under <span class="reference">NEPA</span> . . . establishing that GHG emissions and climate change impacts are fair game for impact assessment procedures, but that the normal rules apply for determining the level of analysis agencies must provide.</q><a href="#166" class="apex">166</a> Most <span class="reference">NEPA</span> claims had been unsuccessful, but some more recent cases have found treatment of climate change in <span class="reference">environmental impact statements (EIS)</span> inadequate.<a href="#167" class="apex">167</a> The <span class="organization">Council on Environmental Quality</span> provided guidance for federal agency consideration of GHG emissions and climate change effects under the <span class="reference">NEPA</span>.<a href="#168" class="apex">168</a> A 2017 executive order required that guidance to be withdrawn, but the withdrawal in April 2017 did not change any <q>legally binding requirement,</q><a href="#169" class="apex">169</a> so the <span class="reference">NEPA</span> will continue to require consideration of climate change in environmental assessments and EIS.</p>

				<p>Plaintiffs—often environmental advocacy groups acting on behalf of their members—in many of these <span class="reference">NEPA</span> cases have sued to force analysis of climate change by federal agencies or to challenge the sufficiency of analysis in an <span class="reference">EIS</span>. A few decisions have required consideration of climate change in impact assessment.<a href="#170" class="apex">170</a> Many others have evaluated agencies’ climate change analysis under a deferential standard of review and found the agency’s analysis adequate.<a href="#171" class="apex">171</a></p>

				<p>For example, a recent <span class="reference">NEPA</span> case brought by environmental advocacy organizations on behalf of their individual members is <span class="event">WildEarth Guardians v. U.S. Forest Service</span>.<a href="#172" class="apex">172</a> Petitioners in consolidated cases challenged <span class="organization">Forest Service</span> approvals of coal leases, alleging violations of the <span class="reference">NEPA</span> and other statutes. Petitioners claimed that the coal leases on federal land in Wyoming had major impacts on CO2 emissions, affected global climate change, and threatened members’ enjoyment of the leased land areas. Members’ documentation of the effects of leases on their use and enjoyment of the areas satisfied standing requirements.<a href="#173" class="apex">173</a> Nonetheless, the court affirmed the agency decisions. In the <span class="reference">EIS</span> prepared for the coal leases, the <span class="organization">Forest Service</span> and <span class="organization">Bureau of Land Management</span> <q>did not ignore the effects of coal combustion, GHGs and climate change</q> and considered risk of harm.<a href="#174" class="apex">174</a> Applying a deferential standard of review, the court held that the <span class="reference">NEPA</span> analysis was not arbitrary and capricious. This decision, however, has been criticized as portraying <q>an interpretation of <span class="reference">NEPA</span> shorn of its capacity to compel agencies to consider how their decisions impact the energy infrastructure that is at the heart of climate change.</q><a href="#175" class="apex">175</a></p>

				<p>Some plaintiffs seeking mitigation of climate change fail to satisfy threshold requirements. In <span class="event">Amigos Bravos v. U.S. BLM</span>,<a href="#176" class="apex">176</a> for example, citizen environmental groups alleged, among other claims, that <span class="organization">BLM</span> approval of gas leases on almost 69,000 acres in <span class="place">New Mexico</span> violated several federal statutes by failing to address climate change, global warming, and GHG emissions. Although environmental groups have standing to sue if their members would have standing, these plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that their members suffered injury in fact because they presented no factual support or scientific evidence for their allegations that climate change would impact members’ lives significantly or that climate change would cause imminent harm to the environment in New Mexico, nor did they show that their members used the land subject to <span class="organization">BLM</span> leases. Further, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the <span class="organization">BLM</span>’s approval of the leases made a <q>meaningful contribution</q> to climate change; therefore the court also concluded that plaintiffs failed to show that their alleged harms were <q>fairly traceable</q> to the <span class="organization">BLM</span>’s actions. The federal district court therefore dismissed the suit for lack of standing.<a href="#177" class="apex">177</a></p>

				<h4>State Impact Assessment</h4>
				<p>Of the many state law impact assessment cases (142, in the <span class="reference">Sabin Center Database</span>, with a number filed recently), few have named individual plaintiffs. More typical are cases with associations as plaintiffs. State claims, especially under the <span class="reference">California Environmental Quality Act</span>,<a href="#178" class="apex">178</a> have been more successful than cases under the <span class="reference">NEPA</span>.<a href="#179" class="apex">179</a> In <span class="event">Center for Biological Diversity v. City of Desert Hot Springs</span>,<a href="#180" class="apex">180</a> for example, a California trial court held that the <span class="reference">environmental impact report (EIR)</span> required under California law was inadequate, in part because it failed to determine the effects of a large development project on GHGs or global warming.</p>

				<p>Some individual plaintiffs challenged consideration of climate change in assessments of local projects, with mixed success. For example, individual plaintiffs challenged their county’s failure to prepare an <span class="reference">EIR</span> (instead of a less detailed statement) for a subdivision intended for agro-industrial development.<a href="#181" class="apex">181</a> Among plaintiffs’ allegations was the failure to consider the environmental effects of odors and other emissions from livestock facilities, effects on air quality, and increased GHG emissions. After the trial court denied plaintiff’s claims, the appellate court held that county approval of the subdivision was a project under the <span class="reference">CEQA</span> and required preparation of an <span class="reference">EIR</span> because of impact on traffic at an intersection adjacent to the site, but not because the county’s climate change analysis was deficient.</p>

				<p>In another case, an individual and two associations challenged the <span class="reference">EIR</span> on <span class="reference">San Francisco’s 2005 Bicycle Plan</span>, prepared under the <span class="reference">California Environmental Quality Act</span>.<a href="#182" class="apex">182</a> The trial court ruled that the <span class="reference">EIR</span> complied with the Act, but the individual plaintiff appealed the order, alleging that the 2000-page <span class="reference">EIR</span> was deficient. The appellate court rejected arguments (among others) that the <span class="reference">EIR</span>, which considered GHG emissions, did not adequately consider climate change and other environmental effects of the Bicycle Plan. The court did, however, require revision of the <span class="reference">EIR</span>, which failed to comply with a technical requirement of the Act by omitting specific findings of infeasibility, when the City did not adopt measures that might mitigate significant effects on the environment.</p>

				<h3>D. Adaptation Cases v. Public Actors</h3>
				<p>Climate change policy and litigation in the United States emphasized mitigation, with less focus on adaptation. More recently, however, adaptation has received more attention, both in policy and litigation. State and local law have been particularly important, especially in the context of climate effects on coastal and other communities.<a href="#183" class="apex">183</a> A few cases demand injunctions to require adaptation measures; others seek compensation for property damage.<a href="#184" class="apex">184</a></p>

				<h4>Federal Law</h4>
				<p>Cases filed after <span class="event">Hurricane Katrina</span>, though not strictly adaptation cases, sought damages for failure of the <span class="organization">Army Corps of Engineers (ACE)</span> to adapt to the effects of climate change. The Army Corps’ action in widening the <span class="place">Mississippi River Gulf Outlet</span> shipping channel and moving it closer to levees increased storm surge. That is, the government canal increased the risk of flooding, and the Corps did not act to avoid flooding.<a href="#185" class="apex">185</a> Plaintiff’s choice of cause of action, however, was critical. Claims alleging negligence were unsuccessful, but some claims alleging temporary takings resulted in <span class="organization">Court of Claims</span> decisions for plaintiffs.</p>

				<p>In re <span class="reference">Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation</span> addressed tort claims from plaintiffs (some of the more than 400 individuals) who alleged that the Army Corps’ negligent design and failure to maintain the  <span class="place">Mississippi River Gulf Outlet</span> contributed to damage from Hurricane Katrina. The district court concluded that the ACE’s failure to maintain and operate the Gulf Outlet properly led to severe flooding.<a href="#186" class="apex">186</a> The court held, in part, that the discretionary function exception to the federal  <span class="reference">Tort Claims Act</span>< did not apply.<a href="#187" class="apex">187</a></p>

				<p>The  <span class="organization">Fifth Circuit</span> affirmed most of the district court’s legal conclusions,<a href="#188" class="apex">188</a> but then granted the government’s petition for rehearing and withdrew its opinion. On rehearing, the same panel held the government was immune from liability under the discretionary function exception to the  <span class="reference">Tort Claims Act</span>.<a href="#189" class="apex">189</a> Its decision for the government affected the bellwether plaintiffs whose cases had been litigated, as well as other claimants who alleged negligence.</p>

				<p>In other litigation after  <span class="event">Hurricane Katrina</span>, the <span class="organization">St. Bernard Parish government</span> and individual property owners filed a <span class="reference">Fifth Amendment Takings Clause</span> claim against the United States.<a href="#190" class="apex">190</a> Plaintiffs claimed that the Army Corps’ operation of the <span class="place">Mississippi River Gulf Outlet</span> had increased storm surge and flooding after <span class="event">Hurricane Katrina</span> and subsequent hurricanes, resulting in temporary taking of their property.</p>

				<p>The 2015 <span class="organization">Court of Claims</span> liability decision relied on factual determinations in Katrina Canal Breaches, which found that the Army Corps’ negligence in maintaining and operating the Gulf Outlet was a substantial cause of the flooding.<a href="#191" class="apex">191</a> The court in <span class="place">St. Bernard Parish</span> held that plaintiffs had protected property interests with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and that the severe and foreseeable flooding constituted a temporary taking.<a href="#192" class="apex">192</a></p>

				<p>In 2016, after failure of the parties to settle or mediate, the <span class="organization">Court of Claims</span> calculated just compensation for the plaintiffs’ damages.<a href="#193" class="apex">193</a> Because property was not lost or destroyed, plaintiffs received no compensation for the value of their fee-simple interest. Instead, they received compensation for the value of replacement improvements on the property and for loss of rent as a result of flooding. The judge entered a final partial judgment with just compensation for eleven <q>trial properties,</q> certified a class of property owners, and appointed class counsel. The <span class="organization">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</span> will review the <span class="organization">Court of Claims</span>’ decisions.<a href="#194" class="apex">194</a></p>

				<p>As these federal court decisions suggest, <q>[c]urrent tort doctrine shields the government in most cases from negligence suits related to climate change adaptation,</q> but government defendants may be more vulnerable to takings claims, which do not require unreasonable government action.<a href="#195" class="apex">195</a> Takings claims could address the failure to take adaptive measures, taking ineffective measures, or actions that increase property losses. But these actions do not fit <q>the traditional paradigm of the Takings Clause, wherein the government is held liable for directly causing a loss of property that otherwise would not have happened</q>; for Takings Clause liability, government actions should be <q>both the but-for and the proximate cause of property loss.</q><a href="#196" class="apex">196</a> In some instances, however, government failure to prevent property losses—that is, <q>passive takings</q>—could lead to liability, and the St Bernard Parish case might support that approach.<a href="#197" class="apex">197</a></p>

				<h4>State Law</h4>
				<p>Individual and other plaintiffs can bring adaptation cases against states and local governmental units; negligence, takings, and fraud are possible causes of action. Some experts argue that tort law is appropriate for <q>adaptation liability,</q> particularly if plaintiffs can prove that defendants’ actions were unreasonable <q>in light of the well-established science of climate change</q> and the expectation that governments will provide adaptive infrastructure.<a href="#198" class="apex">198</a></p>

				<p>Sovereign immunity poses obstacles for state law cases, particularly for fraud and some negligence claims, but is less likely to bar takings claims.<a href="#199" class="apex">199</a> Although government tort claims acts waive sovereign immunity in some situations (dangerous conditions or failure to maintain public property), sovereign immunity may protect state and local governments from tort liability for actions involving discretionary functions, nonstructural measures, failure to adopt regulations, or failure to provide benefits that states have no duty to provide.<a href="#200" class="apex">200</a> Despite some immunity for state and local governments, <q>when governments act as landowners they are subject to liability for impacts from their construction and operation of structural measures.</q><a href="#201" class="apex">201</a></p>

				<p>Few adaptation cases involve individual plaintiffs. In a recent New York case, plaintiff homeowners sustained water damage to their property after severe storms in 2011 overwhelmed the sewer system. They sued the City of <span class="place">New York</span> and its <span class="organization">Department of Environmental Protection</span> in negligence for failure to maintain sewer lines to prevent flooding. The City claimed that it had no knowledge of maintenance issues or defective conditions. Under New York law, a municipality is immune from negligence for discretionary activities (designing a sewer or drainage system). For ministerial actions (negligent maintenance), liability exists only if the municipality violates a special duty to the plaintiff, beyond the duty to the public. The city owed no special duty to plaintiffs, nor did plaintiffs prove negligence; the <q>sole proximate cause</q> of flooding was precipitation. Therefore, the court granted summary judgment to the city and dismissed the case.<a href="#202" class="apex">202</a> Similarly, in Illinois, plaintiffs sued to recover for flooding of their homes after heavy rainfall. In consolidated cases, the court dismissed claims against <span class="place">Cook County</span> and other government defendants under the public duty rule, which applies to provision of government services owed to the public at large, rather than to individual plaintiffs.<a href="#203" class="apex">203</a></p>

				<p>Individuals are defendants, rather than plaintiffs, in eminent domain, which allows governments to acquire property for projects to adapt to the effects of climate change. In a New Jersey case, the local government took permanent easements over beachfront property to construct a 20-foot dune. The easement covered a quarter of the owners’ property; the dune obstructed their beach view, but offered significant protection to the owners and others in the community. In a dispute over just compensation, a jury awarded the owners $375,000, and an appellate court affirmed. The <span class="organization">New Jersey Supreme Court</span>, reversing, held that just compensation for a partial taking

					<q>must be based on a consideration of all relevant, reasonably calculable, and non-conjectural factors that either decrease or increase the value of the remaining property. In a partial-takings case, homeowners are entitled to the fair market value of their loss, not to a windfall, not to a pay out that disregards the home’s enhanced value resulting from a public project.<a href="#204" class="apex">204</a></q>
				</p>
				
				<p>Ultimately, the owners settled for $1. Fair-market-value analysis may decrease the cost of adaptation measures, if just compensation for eminent domain considers benefits, as well as losses, from the project to property owners.<a href="#205" class="apex">205</a></p>

				<h3>E. Climate Change Cases v. Private Actors</h3>
				<p>Relatively few individual climate change plaintiffs have sued private actors. Owners of private facilities are not protected by sovereign immunity, but the <span class="reference">Clean Air Act</span> displaces some federal common law claims.<a href="#206" class="apex">206</a> State tort law claims may remain viable, and some argue that tort claims are particularly appropriate, in part because <q>the primary goals of tort law [are] . . . its ability to resolve disputes between individuals while galvanizing changed behavior amongst communities.</q><a href="#207" class="apex">207</a> Nonetheless, tort cases against private actors have not been particularly successful.<a href="#208" class="apex">208</a> Impediments to recovery for property damage include proving a breach of duty by past emitters and a causal connection between emissions and harms, as well as the complexity of tort cases.<a href="#209" class="apex">209</a> Claims against property developers, or perhaps engineers and architects, who should recognize climate change vulnerability of land that they sell or develop, may be less difficult, but others issues—for example, foreseeability of harm from climate change—may pose obstacles to recovery.<a href="#210" class="apex">210</a></p>

				<p><span class="event">Comer v. Murphy Oil USA</span> was a putative class action lawsuit against a number of energy corporations brought by a dozen individuals who owned coastal property destroyed by <span class="event">Hurricane Katrina</span>. Plaintiffs sued for damages under Mississippi common law claims of public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence, as well as other claims.<a href="#211" class="apex">211</a> The <span class="organization">Fifth Circuit</span> held that the landowners had standing for the tort actions, but not the other claims, and that the tort claims were not barred as a nonjusticiable political question. The opinion was vacated when the court granted rehearing en banc,<a href="#212" class="apex">212</a> but judicial recusals led to a lack of quorum for the rehearing, and the court did not reinstate the vacated opinion.<a href="#213" class="apex">213</a></p>

				<p>More recently, a pending citizen suit brought by <span class="organization">Conservation Law Foundation</span> on behalf of its individual members seeks declarative and injunctive relief and civil penalties. Plaintiffs allege that <span class="organization">ExxonMobil</span>’s storage terminal (with toxic and hazardous chemicals) poses a risk to public health and the environment, in part because <span class="organization">ExxonMobil</span> failed to adapt to effects of climate change, so a storm surge, sea level rise, or extreme rain could flood the facility.<a href="#214" class="apex">214</a> In September 2017, the federal district court denied defendant’s motion to dismiss claims for short-term damages, but held that plaintiffs lacked standing for claims for damages not likely to occur until 2050 or 2100.</p>

				<p>Private actors may also be defendants in suits by governmental units. In July 2017, three local governments in <span class="place">California</span> sued thirty-seven private oil, gas, and coal companies alleged to be responsible for 20% of pollution from CO2 and methane from 1965 to 2015.<a href="#215" class="apex">215</a> Causes of action in the complaints include public nuisance, private nuisance, negligence, trespass, and strict liability for failure to warn and design defect. Quoting industry documents showing that since the 1960s defendants knew, but concealed their knowledge, that GHG pollution from fossil fuels affected climate and sea levels, plaintiffs alleged that defendants’ conduct led to continued sea-level rise that injured plaintiffs and their citizens. Plaintiffs’ claims for relief include compensatory and punitive damages, abatement of nuisances, disgorgement of profits, and other costs.<a href="#216" class="apex">216</a></p>

				<p>Individual plaintiffs have claimed climate change fraud, alleging that energy companies have misled investors and the public about the risks of climate change from their activities. A recent case filed in Texas on behalf of investors alleged that ExxonMobil had committed securities fraud by failure to disclose climate-related risks.<a href="#217" class="apex">217</a></p>

				<p>Fraud may become more significant in climate change cases. The <span class="organization">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span> advised companies <q>to consider climate change and its consequences,</q> including physical impacts and extreme weather conditions, in disclosure documents.<a href="#218" class="apex">218</a> Moreover, the SEC and others are investigating misleading statements from energy companies,<a href="#219" class="apex">219</a> and an environmental organization petitioned for <span class="organization">ExxonMobil</span>’s suspension as a government contractor because of its deceptive behavior and <q>campaign of misinformation</q> on climate change.<a href="#220" class="apex">220</a> Recent research concluded that energy companies knew of the risks of climate change, had the opportunity to reduce those risks, but instead acted to misinform the public.<a href="#221" class="apex">221</a></p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>As the discussion above indicates, climate change litigation raises complex issues, especially for private plaintiffs. Regulatory challenges as well some common law and constitutional claims are possible causes of action, but few plaintiffs have been successful. Moreover, threshold issues, including standing, the political question doctrine, and displacement, sometimes pose obstacles. Proof of causation also raises special difficulties for individual and other plaintiffs. Although U.S. <q>courts to date have been unwilling to impose civil liability on private entities,</q> science may help <q>address some of the causation and apportionment hurdles that have made these cases challenging.</q><a href="#222" class="apex">222</a> Even so, individual plaintiffs may conclude that lawsuits to mitigate or adapt to climate change are not financially viable. Environmental and other nongovernmental organizations, rather than individual plaintiffs, are more likely to have the resources to pursue climate change litigation.</p>

But that argument misses the point. This action is of a different order than the typical environmental case.
